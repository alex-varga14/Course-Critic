The backend unit tests are run via the command 'npm test'
The database tables must be freshly created, to ensure the
autoincrement IDs begin at one. Then, the test data in the
UnitTestData.sql file must be loaded into the system. The
test cases will inject data into the database as necessary
to run the tests after these starting conditions are met.
