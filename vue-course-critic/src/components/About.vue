                Gone are the days of going into your first day of classes without knowing what it's like. 
                Course Critic is a website dedicated to providing reviews for university courses from students who took them in the past.
                You can't get better reviews about your university courses than from students who took it before you!
                <br><br>
                If you would like to rate a course but don't see it in the course list yet, send a suggestion in our Suggest Course page 
                and one of our administrators will review it. You can also take a look at the entire collection of courses in our system 
                by looking at our All Courses page. Contributors are NOT required to log into the system to enjoy the full benefits of 
                this program. Only the administrators need to sign in to approve suggested courses from contributors.
